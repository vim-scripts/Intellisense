This is the JSP plugin of Intellisense. 
You need Intellisense core package for this to work, which you can download from http://insenvim.sourceforge.net or http://sourceforge.net/projects/insenvim.
You also need Java and HTML plugin for this to work.
A new HTML plugin is available, and you should install it. It fixes one big problem.
